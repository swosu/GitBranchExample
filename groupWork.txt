This is our group project.

This is part 1.

part 2
This is Roshan.
I take in the date as a variable.
I then look up what the zodiac sign.
I store the zodiac sign as a different variable.

part 3
This is Conner.
I am going to take the resulting zodiac variable
and print it off.
That is the end of the program.
